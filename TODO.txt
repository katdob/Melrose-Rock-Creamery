- customize frontend 
-- define content for each tab 
-- recipe card for recipe ui container 
-- decide on fonts 
-- nginx to ensure that you don't need to handle headers in the api call files 

- customize backend 
-- define models 
-- how does .NET handle data migrations? 
-- how does .NET do api endpoints? 
-- make sure that nobody can run a sneaky api query from the browser 

- customize database 
-- make a seed_database file and have it OPTIONALLY run immediately after the backend is up and connected to the db 
-- fill with the seed data 
-- have it populate from a snapshot of an already seeded database
