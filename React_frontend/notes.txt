Welcome to Melrose Rock Creamery! 

We are more than an ice cream shop. We're also your local makerspace, but for frozen treats! 

You can make and sell your ice cream here. Or, you can make recipes for our Super Scoopers to serve to customers.
This includes milkshakes, sundaes, floats, and more. 

Our tasting room is open from 10am - 2pm and 6pm - 11pm every day. 

At our facility near Boston we have the following equipment:
[EquipmentOne]
[EquipmentTwo]
[EquipmentThree]
[EquipmentFour]
[EquipmentFive]
[EquipmentSix]

To use the purely fictional facilities at Melrose Rock Creamery, you must be a member. 
We charge a monthly membership fee. See the details of using our kitchen [here].
